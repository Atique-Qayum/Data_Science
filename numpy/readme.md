# Divisibility Rules in Mathematics

This repository contains information about divisibility rules for various numbers in mathematics.

## Divisibility Rules

### Divisibility by 2
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

### Divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

### Divisibility by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

### Divisibility by 6
A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

### Divisibility by 9
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

### Divisibility by 10
A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.
