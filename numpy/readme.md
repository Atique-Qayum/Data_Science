# Divisibility Rules in Mathematics

This repository contains information about divisibility rules for various numbers in mathematics.

## Divisibility Rules

### Divisibility by 2
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

### Divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

### Divisibility by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

### Divisibility by 6
A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

### Divisibility by 9
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

### Divisibility by 10
A number is divisible by 10 if it ends in 0.

## Usage
You can refer to these rules to quickly check the divisibility of numbers by these common divisors.

# GCD and LCM in Mathematics

This repository contains information about two important concepts in number theory: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM).

## Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the given integers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the greatest common factor shared by those integers.

For example:
- The GCD of 8 and 12 is 4 because 4 is the largest integer that divides both 8 and 12 without leaving a remainder.
- The GCD of 15, 20, and 25 is 5 because 5 is the largest integer that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder.

## Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given integers. In other words, it is the smallest common multiple of those integers.

For example:
- The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12 because 12 is the smallest integer that is divisible by both 4 and 6.
- The LCM of 8, 12, and 15 is 120 because 120 is the smallest integer that is divisible by all three numbers.

## Usage

You can use the GCD and LCM concepts in various mathematical problems, such as simplifying fractions, solving equations, and finding common factors or multiples.
