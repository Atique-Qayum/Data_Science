## Divisibility Rules

### Divisibility by 2
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

### Divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

### Divisibility by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

### Divisibility by 6
A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

### Divisibility by 9
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

### Divisibility by 10

# GCD and LCM in Mathematics

This repository contains information about two important concepts in number theory: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM).

## Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the given integers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the greatest common factor shared by those integers.

For example:
- The GCD of 8 and 12 is 4 because 4 is the largest integer that divides both 8 and 12 without leaving a remainder.
- The GCD of 15, 20, and 25 is 5 because 5 is the largest integer that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder.

## Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given integers. In other words, it is the smallest common multiple of those integers.

For example:
- The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12 because 12 is the smallest integer that is divisible by both 4 and 6.
- The LCM of 8, 12, and 15 is 120 because 120 is the smallest integer that is divisible by all three numbers.

## Usage

You can use the GCD and LCM concepts in various mathematical problems, such as simplifying fractions, solving equations, and finding common factors or multiples.

# Modulus in Mathematics

Modulus in mathematics refers to the remainder of a division operation. It's the value that remains after dividing one number by another. 

For example:
- In the expression 7 mod 3, the modulus is 1 because when 7 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.
- Similarly, 10 mod 4 equals 2 because when 10 is divided by 4, the remainder is 2.

Modulus is commonly denoted by the symbol "%". It is widely used in various mathematical operations and concepts, including modular arithmetic and computer programming.


# Real-World Examples of Modulus Usage

Modulus, often denoted by the symbol `%`, finds applications in various real-world scenarios. Here are four examples:

- **Clocks and Timekeeping Systems**: Modulus is used to determine the current time in systems like digital clocks and watches. It helps convert hour values to the appropriate range for display in 12-hour formats.

- **Recurring Events and Scheduling**: Modulus is employed to schedule recurring events like meetings, reminders, or maintenance tasks. By calculating the current time modulo the interval between events, systems can determine when the next occurrence should happen.

- **Data Storage and Addressing**: In computer science, modulus is used in data storage and addressing schemes, particularly in hash functions and memory allocation algorithms. It helps map data to specific locations within data structures or memory blocks efficiently.

- **Image Processing and Graphics Rendering**: Modulus is utilized in image processing and graphics rendering to wrap around pixel coordinates. This wrapping allows for seamless tiling and repeated patterns in textures or backgrounds, enhancing visual aesthetics in video games, digital art, and graphic design.

# The Power of Ratios and Proportions in Algebra

## Ratios

| Topic                            | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Writing and Simplifying Ratios  | Ratios compare two quantities by division. Write them consistently and simplify as needed.   | Ratio of 8 oranges to 4 apples: 8:4, simplified to 2:1        |
| Equivalent Ratios               | Equivalent ratios have the same value when simplified, even though they may look different. | Ratios 2:1 and 4:2 are equivalent, both simplify to 2:1       |

## Proportions

| Topic             | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Setting up Proportions | A proportion is an equation stating two ratios are equal. Setup involves four related quantities. | If 2 oranges cost $1, how much do 6 oranges cost? Setup: 2/1 = 6/x             |
| Solving Proportions    | To solve proportions, find the value of the variable making the two ratios equal.               | Example: 2/1 = 6/x, solving yields x = 3, so 6 oranges cost $3.                 |

## Variation

| Type              | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct Variation  | Two quantities increase or decrease together at the same rate.                                | If y varies directly with x and y = 2 when x = 1, then y = 2x.                   |
| Inverse Variation | One quantity increases while the other decreases, with their product being constant.          | If y varies inversely with x and y = 1 when x = 2, then xy = 2.                 |

|                                             |                                                                                               | Convert 50% to fraction: 50% = 50/100 = 1/2.                  |
| Finding Percentages of Numbers             | Convert percentage to decimal and multiply by the number to find percentage of a number.     | Find 20% of 50: 20% = 0.20, 0.20 × 50 = 10.                   |
| Percentage Increase and Decrease           | Measure how much a number has gone up or down in percentage terms.                           | Percentage increase: [(65 – 50) ÷ 50] × 100 = 30% increase.  |
|                                             |                                                                                               | Percentage decrease: [(30 – 25) ÷ 30] × 100 ≈ 16.67% decrease. |

# Pre-Algebra Problem Solving

## Strategies for Problem Solving

## Strategies for Problem Solving: A Concrete Example

### Example Problem
Shamsa is planning a birthday party. She has a budget of $150 and wants to buy party favors that cost $5 each. How many party favors can she buy?

### Understanding the Problem
Shamsa needs to calculate the maximum number of party favors she can buy without exceeding her budget.

### Devising a Plan
She will divide the total budget by the cost of one party favor to find out the maximum number she can purchase.

### Carrying Out the Plan
Shamsa carries out the calculation: $150 divided by $5 per party favor equals 30 party favors.

### Reviewing/Extending the Solution
She reviews her calculation to ensure she hasn’t exceeded the budget and considers if there are any discounts for buying in bulk that could allow her to purchase more favors or save money.

## Example Questions for Pre-Algebra

Here are a few example questions to practice your concepts of pre-algebra:

1. What is the value of \( 3x + 5 \) when \( x = 4 \)?
2. Solve the equation \( 2(x + 3) = 14 \).
3. Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 8 units and width 5 units.
