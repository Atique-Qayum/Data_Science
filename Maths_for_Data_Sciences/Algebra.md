## Examples

### Example 1: Solving the equation `2x + 3 = 7`
- Given equation: `2x + 3 = 7`
- Subtract 3 from both sides: `2x = 7 - 3 = 4`
- Divide both sides by 2: `x = 4 รท 2 = 2`

### Example 2: Solving the equation `3y - 5 = 10`
- Given equation: `3y - 5 = 10`
- Add 5 to both sides: `3y = 10 + 5 = 15`
- Divide both sides by 3: `y = 15 รท 3 = 5`

### Example 3: Solving the equation `4z + 8 = 20`
- Given equation: `4z + 8 = 20`
- Subtract 8 from both sides: `4z = 20 - 8 = 12`
