Understanding these basics is your first step in the journey into pre-algebra, providing the foundational language and concepts that will support your mathematical growth.

# Chapter 2: The World of Fractions and Decimals

## Simplifying Fractions

To simplify a fraction, you divide the top and bottom by the highest number that divides into both exactly.

Example: Simplify 8/12. Both 8 and 12 can be divided by 4, so (8÷4)/(12÷4) = 2/3.

## Common Denominator in Algebra

A common denominator is a shared multiple of the denominators of two or more fractions. It’s used to add or subtract fractions.

Example: To add 1/4 and 3/5, find a common denominator, which is 20, so 1/4 = 5/20 and 3/5 = 12/20.

## Adding and Subtracting Fractions in Algebra

Fractions must have a common denominator to be added or subtracted. Then you add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

Example: 5/20 + 12/20 = 17/20.

## Multiplying and Dividing Fractions in Algebra

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and denominators separately. To divide, flip the second fraction and multiply.

Example: 2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 simplifies to 1/2. For division, 2/3 ÷ 3/4 = 2/3 × 4/3 = 8/9.

## Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions in Algebra

A mixed number combines a whole number and a fraction, while an improper fraction has a numerator larger than its denominator.

Example: 3½ is a mixed number. To convert it to an improper fraction: 3 × 2 + 1 = 7, so 3½ becomes 7/2.

## Decimals 

### Converting Fractions to Decimals

To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.

Example: 3/4 becomes 0.75 because 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75.

### Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying, and Dividing Decimals

When adding or subtracting decimals, align the decimal points. For multiplication, multiply as with whole numbers, and count the total number of decimal places in both factors for the result. Division is done like whole numbers, but you may need to move the decimal point.

Example: 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75, and 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.10. For division, 0.75 ÷ 0.5 = 1.5.

### Rounding Decimals

Rounding decimals involves shortening a decimal to a certain number of decimal places, based on the next digit.

Example: Round 3.14159 to two decimal places: Since the third decimal is 1, round down to 3.14.

### Decimal Places and Significant Figures

Decimal places count the numbers after the decimal point. Significant figures include all the meaningful digits in a number, not just after the decimal.

Example: In 123.45, there are two decimal places and five significant figures.

# Chapter 3: The Power of Ratios and Proportions in Algebra

## Ratios

### Writing and Simplifying Ratios

Ratios compare two quantities by division. When writing ratios, it’s important to keep the order consistent and simplify them as much as possible.

Example: The ratio of 8 oranges to 4 apples can be written as 8:4 and simplified to 2:1.

### Equivalent Ratios

Equivalent ratios have the same value when simplified, even though they may look different.

Example: The ratios 2:1 and 4:2 are equivalent because when both are simplified, they result in the same ratio of 2:1.

## Proportions

### Setting up Proportions

A proportion is an equation that states two ratios are equal. To set up a proportion, you need to have four related quantities.

Example: If 2 oranges cost $1, how much do 6 oranges cost? The proportion would be 2/1 = 6/x, where x is the cost of 6 oranges.

### Solving Proportions

To solve proportions, find the value of the variable that makes the two ratios equal.

Example: To solve 2/1 = 6/x, cross-multiply to get 2x = 6, then divide both sides by 2 to find x = 3. So, 6 oranges cost $3.

## Direct Variation

Direct variation occurs when two quantities increase or decrease together at the same rate.

Example: If y varies directly with x and y = 2 when x = 1, then the equation of direct variation is y = 2x.

## Inverse Variation

Inverse variation happens when one quantity increases while the other decreases. Their product is a constant.

Example: If y varies inversely with x and y = 1 when x = 2, then the equation of inverse variation is xy = 2.

# Chapter 4: Mastering the Art of Percentages in Algebra

## Understanding Percentages

### Converting Fractions and Decimals to Percentages

Percentages are a way of expressing numbers as a fraction of 100. To convert a fraction or a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100 and add the percent symbol (%) at the end.

Example: Convert 0.75 to a percentage: 0.75 × 100 = 75%.

Example: Convert 3/4 to a percentage: First convert 3/4 to a decimal which is 0.75, then multiply by 100 to get 75%.

### Converting Percentages to Fractions and Decimals

To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100. To convert a percentage to a fraction, write the percentage over 100 and simplify if possible.

Example: Convert 50% to a decimal: 50 ÷ 100 = 0.5.

Example: Convert 50% to a fraction: 50% = 50/100 = 1/2.

### Finding Percentages of Numbers

To find a percentage of a number, convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply by the number.

Example: Find 20% of 50: Convert 20% to a decimal (0.20) and multiply by 50 (0.20 × 50 = 10).

### Percentage Increase and Decrease

Percentage increase or decrease measures how much a number has gone up or down in percentage terms.

Example: If a shirt was $50 and now is $65, the percentage increase is calculated as: [(65 – 50) ÷ 50] × 100 = 30% increase.

Example: If a stock price drops from $30 to $25, the percentage decrease is: [(30 – 25) ÷ 30] × 100 = approximately 16.67% decrease.

# Chapter 5: Unveiling the Mystery of Variables and Expressions in Algebra

## Working with Variables

### Understanding Variables

Variables are symbols that represent unknown values. They are used to hold a value that can change or vary. In algebra, variables are often represented by letters such as x, y, or z.

Example: In the expression x + 5, x is a variable.

### Algebraic Expressions

An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables, and operators (like add, subtract, multiply, and divide).

Example: 3x + 2y – 7 is an algebraic expression.

### Simplifying Expressions

Simplifying expressions involves combining like terms and reducing expressions to their simplest form.

Example: Simplify 2x + 3x to get 5x.

### Solving Equations

#### One-step Equations

One-step equations are algebraic equations that can be solved in one step by either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Example: Solve x + 7 = 10 by subtracting 7 from both sides to get x = 3.

#### Two-step Equations

Two-step equations require two steps to solve. This often involves a combination of operations.

Example: Solve 2x + 3 = 7 by first subtracting 3 from both sides to get 2x = 4, then dividing both sides by 2 to get x = 2.

#### Multi-step Equations

Multi-step equations may involve several operations and require multiple steps to solve, including the use of the distributive property and combining like terms.

Example: Solve 3(x + 2) – 4 = 11 by first applying the distributive property, then combining like terms, and finally isolating the variable x.

### Solving Inequalities

#### Graphing Inequalities

Graphing inequalities involves shading a region of the number line or coordinate plane that represents all solutions to the inequality.

Example: To graph x > 3 on a number line, put an open circle at 3 and shade to the right.

#### Compound Inequalities

Compound inequalities involve two separate inequalities that are joined by either “and” or “or”.

Example: The compound inequality 2 < x and x < 5 means x is greater than 2 and less than 5.

# Chapter 6: Measurement and Geometry Foundations

## Units of Measurement

### Length, Mass, Volume, and Time

Units of measurement are used to quantify physical quantities. Length is measured in meters, centimeters, feet, etc., mass in kilograms or pounds, volume in liters or gallons, and time in seconds, minutes, hours, etc.

### Metric and Imperial Units

The metric system uses units like meters, liters, and grams, while the imperial system uses units like feet, gallons, and pounds.

### Unit Conversion

Unit conversion involves changing a quantity expressed in one set of units to another set of units using a conversion factor.

Example: Convert 5 kilometers to miles by multiplying 5 by the conversion factor 0.621371 (5 km * 0.621371 = 3.106855 miles).

## Introduction to Geometry

### Points, Lines, and Angles

Points are locations in space, lines are one-dimensional figures that extend infinitely, and angles are formed by two rays meeting at a point.

### Triangles

Triangles are three-sided polygons characterized by three edges and three vertices. The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

### Quadrilaterals

Quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons with various types including squares, rectangles, and parallelograms.

### Circles

A circle is a round shape where every point on the boundary is the same distance from the center. The distance around a circle is its circumference.

### Perimeter and Area

The perimeter of a shape is the distance around it, while the area is the measure of space inside it.

Example: The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), and the area is length * width.

### Surface Area and Volume

Surface area is the total area that the surface of an object occupies, and volume measures the space an object occupies.

Example: The surface area of a cube is 6 * (edge length)^2, and its volume is (edge length)^3.
