## Key Concepts

- **Vector Spaces**: Sets of vectors that satisfy certain properties under addition and scalar multiplication.
- **Linear Equations**: Equations that involve only linear combinations of variables and constants.
- **Matrices and Vectors**: Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, and vectors are special types of matrices.
- **Linear Transformations**: Functions that preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication.
- **Systems of Linear Equations**: Collections of linear equations involving the same set of variables.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Special properties associated with linear transformations.
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Decomposition of a matrix into singular vectors and singular values.

## Applications

Linear algebra finds applications in various fields, including:

- **Computer Graphics**: Used for rendering images, modeling objects, and simulating physical phenomena.
