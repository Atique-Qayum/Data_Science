| Time Period | Civilization/Individuals | Development/Contribution | Examples |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| Ancient Babylonians (2000-1600 BCE) | Babylonians | Developed early algebraic methods for solving linear and quadratic equations. | Solving linear equations like 2x + 3 = 9. |
| Ancient Egyptians (2000-1550 BCE) | Egyptians | Utilized algebraic techniques for solving practical problems related to construction and trade. | Calculating the area of a rectangular field given its dimensions. |
| Ancient Greeks (600-300 BCE) | Greeks (notably Diophantus) | Introduced symbolic notation and studied algebraic properties. | Solving indeterminate equations, like Diophantine equations. |
| Islamic Golden Age (8th-15th centuries) | Scholars like Al-Khwarizmi | Al-Khwarizmi's "Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala" laid the foundations of algebra as a discipline. | Solving quadratic equations using completing the square method. |
| Renaissance Europe (15th-16th centuries) | Mathematicians like François Viète | Viète introduced new algebraic notation and techniques, paving the way for symbolic algebra. | Introducing letters as variables in algebraic equations, such as using x, y, z. |
| 17th-19th centuries | Mathematicians like René Descartes, Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz | Development of analytic geometry, calculus, and algebraic concepts. | Descartes' coordinate system linking algebra with geometry. |
| Modern Era (20th century onwards) | Various mathematicians | Algebra evolves into a vast field, influencing diverse areas like cryptography, coding theory, and computer science. | Applications in cryptography for secure communication, like RSA algorithm. |
