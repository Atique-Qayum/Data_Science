# AI and Machine Learning Study Guide

This project aims to document my self-guided learning journey in various topics related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their applications.

## What Will You Learn?

- **AI** - Gain a high-level understanding of what artificial intelligence is, its history and different subfields like machine learning.

- **Mathematics** - Brush up on foundational math concepts like linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics that are essential for machine learning. 

- **Machine Learning** - Get hands-on with popular machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, SVMs, decision trees, clustering and recommenders. 

- **Deep Learning** - Dive into deep neural networks, CNNs, RNNs and how they have revolutionized image, text and time series prediction tasks.

- **Web Apps** - Build full-stack web applications that integrate machine learning models to power features like image recognition, query parsing etc.

- **Statistics** - Learn statistical concepts like estimation, hypothesis testing, Bayes' rule and how they apply to analyzing and evaluating machine learning models.  

- **Prompt Engineering** - Understand how framing problems and structuring data impacts model performance using techniques like prompt engineering.

- **And much more!** As my learning progresses, I'll be adding notes on new topics like natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning and more.

My goal is to not just learn theory but also get hands-on experience applying these concepts on self-directed projects. I hope this collection of notes, code samples and reflections helps document my ML journey and also benefits other learners.

Let me know if you have any other topics you'd like me to explore!
